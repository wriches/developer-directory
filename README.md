# 📁 Sui Developer Directory

This is a list of Sui developers seeking employment or contract opportunities. Projects and employers can browse developer profiles to find potential hires, and developers can submit PRs to include themselves.

## 📌 Developer Profiles

All profiles are stored in the `developers/` directory. Each file represents a developer and includes details like:

- **Name** (real or pseudonymous)
- **GitHub Handle**
- **Location**
- **Programming Experience**
- **Sui Skills**
- **Opportunities Sought**

## 📝 How to Submit Your Profile

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new file in the `developers/` folder named `your-name.md` (e.g. `john-smith.md`). You should copy the contents of [`template.md`](template.md) to get started. Incorrectly formatted entries may not be accepted.
3. Fill out the template and remove the comments in `<!-- -->` tags.
4. Open a Pull Request with the title: `Add [your name] to developer directory`.
